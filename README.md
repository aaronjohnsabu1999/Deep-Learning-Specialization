# Deep-Learning-Specialization

This repository contains the exercise files for the Deep Learning Specialization taught by Prof Andrew Ng and conducted by deeplearning.ai

***
Files have not been added for Course 03: *Improving Deep Neural Networks - Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization*.
This is because the course does not contain any exercise being a machine learning development-based course with solely quizzes.
